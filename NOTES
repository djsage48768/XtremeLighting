Now i want to create a web app that will allow me to issue parts to a JOB by scanning the QR code on each part 

there will be 4 different master parts i have a list of components that go into each of those 4 units

I would like to select the part that we are issuing via drop down menu then a barcode scan field that will allow me to scan the job its going to

I have the list of parts the qty needed and revs for each unit you can find them attached.

These are the 4 units we will be working with 

01H09000-01 REV U
01H08000-01 REV U
01H05000-01 REV T
01H01000-01 REV H

I will then like to scan the QR codes on the parts to issue them. 
the app should show me whats issue and what needs to be issued

the QR codes labels on the parts are encoded with the part, rev, lot, location, and bin
